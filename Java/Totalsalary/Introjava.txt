Write a program to calculate the total salary of a person. The user has to enter the basic salary (an integer) and the grade (an uppercase character), and depending upon which the total salary is calculated as -
    totalSalary = basic + hra + da + allow – pf
where :
hra   = 20% of basic
da    = 50% of basic
allow = 1700 if grade = ‘A’
allow = 1500 if grade = ‘B’
allow = 1300 if grade = ‘C' or any other character
pf    = 11% of basic.


solution:-

import java.util.Scanner;
//import java.math.h;
public class Main {
	
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		// Write your code here
      //  int A=0,B=0,C=0;
        double totalsalary;
		Scanner s = new Scanner(System.in);
        int basic = s.nextInt();
        String str = s.next();
        char ch = str.charAt(0);
        double hra = 0.2*basic;
        double da =0.5*basic;
        double pf = 0.11*basic;
        int allow = 0;
        if(ch == 'A'){
            allow=1700;
        }
        else if(ch == 'B'){
            allow=1500;
        }
        else{
            allow=1300;
        }
        totalsalary = (basic + hra + da + allow - pf);
        System.out.println(Math.round(totalsalary));
        
	}
}
